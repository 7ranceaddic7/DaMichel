## adopted for curation by [zer0Kerbal]; originally authored by [DaMichel](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/profile/93697-damichel/)

***Radial Aerodynamic RTG***, because [DaMichel] could. Has much lower drag in FAR than stock RTG due to not having attach nodes.

Contains two radial parts:
1. PB-NUK-A Aerodynamic Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator - contains a small battery
2. **[NEW]** PB-ZAP : A Radial Aerodynamic Fuel Cell Generator (LF+IA) - contains a small battery
